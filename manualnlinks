For MAC
Consider using the `--user` option or check the permissions.
use: pip install virtualenv --user
If you install latest version of python 3.7 as of Sep 2018
The only workable approach I could figure out (with help from @Gator_Python was to do python -m virtualenv venv. 
This creates the virtual environment and works as expected.
I have custom python installed and maybe that's why the default approach doesn't work for me.
-m runs library module as a script

Installed HomeBrew
brew install tree

https://godjango.com/39-be-more-productive-with-django_extensions/
problem: django-extension is not recognized by the server(module django-extension not found error) whereas we need to write _ in registered app list
---soln: don't put django-extension files as app under your project folder instead just pip install django-extensions,
and django_extensions should go under installed app as said in the documentation, importantly i restarted my Pycharm IDE and
error went away.
